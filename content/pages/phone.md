# Using a dumbphone
I stopped using a smartphone. My current (dumb) phone is a nokia 800 tough.
This idea came up when I realized that I was spending a lot of time on the phone and not getting things done. 
So I got myself a dumbphone and disabled all data traffic. 

So far this is what I can share from the experience
Pros:

* Less distraction.
* Great battery life. I disabled all data communications other other than 2G. The battery lasts 2 weeks. You heard me right. TWO WEEKS! 
* More privacy. Honestly, in $CURRENT_YEAR tweaking a phone to be privacy preserving is like trying to make a car fly. It was not designed for that.
* Its somehow liberating to be less dependant on technology.

Cons:

* Since it does not run messaging apps, I am only able to comunicate via calls/SMS. Most of my friends/family use those apps. So I have to tell them to send me SMS instead.
* Forces me to plan things ahead. Things I would do adhoc such as looking for directions now have to be done beforehand and planned a bit. I am seriously considering buying a map of my city to help me with this.
* Some annoyances here and there. For instance the other day I went to a bar where they only had the menu as "QR CODE"

I leave here a list of common things that I used to do with a
smartphone (and the healthier replacement)

# Navigation / Orientation
I currently live in Copenhagen. Whenever I need to ride my bycicle to a unknown destination, I usually do a bit of preparation at home.
I will fire openstreetmap.org and query for the street name. 
Then I search for a point of reference nearby. Usually there is some point of reference that I know of.
Then I just need to learn how to get from that point to the destination. 

Sometimes I don't have the address of the destination, but just a name of a coffee shop or restaurant. In those cases I do a quick web search to get the address.

Because of this process I am slowly building a mental image of the city, which is a nice thing to have. 

For driving long distances with the car I use a GPS device from TomTom. 

# Waiting periods - Filling the "gaps"
The older me would reach for the phone whenever waiting to fill the so called *gaps*. This was a terribly bad habbit.

Now I try to be at least cognizant of the fact that it is OK to do nothing for a while. Just sit and watch time go by. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Learning not to be bored is a skill!

If I take the metro, I will reflect about my day, do a bit of introspection or even planning. 

For longer waiting periods I usually read on a Kindle.

# Music
I ocasionally like to listen to music at work. To do so I use an old mp3 player. It only contains music without lyrics, since I find those distract me from work. 

# Things I carry everyday
Wrist watch, kindle reader and a notebook. I also have a few COVID vaccination certificate. Printed on paper.

# Letting go of Social Media
The most dificult thing for me to get rid of is youtube. Even though I have no account, I find myself spending time on youtube, jumping endlessly from one video to another. And the thing is, there is actually some good content in there. 
 I mean, just the other day I saw a video of a guy who had plugged a teletype from the 30's onto a raspberry pi using a self built interface. How cool is that? 

 But this is changing now. I am NOT opening youtube *just to have a look*. Those times are over!
