# Vegetable curry

* Prep time: less than 30 mins
* Cook time: 20-30 min
* Servings: 3

## Ingredients

* 2 medium potatoes (around 350g), peeled and cut into 2cm chunks
* 1 large carrot, peeled and sliced diagonally
* ½ cauliflower (around 300g), cut into small florets and halved
* 3 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil
* 1 large onion, coarsely grated or very finely chopped
* 1 tbsp medium or hot curry powder
* 227g tin chopped tomatoes
* 300ml vegetable or chicken stock (made with ½ cube), gluten-free if required
* 100g frozen peas or two large handfuls young spinach leaves, or a mixture

## Directions

* Half-fill a saucepan with cold water and add the potatoes and carrots. Bring to the boil and cook for 8 minutes. Add the cauliflower florets and cook for 2 minutes more. Drain in a colander and set aside.

* Heat the oil in a large, non-stick frying pan or wide-based saucepan. Add the onion and cook over a medium heat for 8 minutes or until well softened and lightly browned, stirring regularly. Sprinkle over the curry powder and cook for 30 seconds more, stirring.

* Add the tomatoes to the onions and cook for 2–3 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the stock and bring to a gentle simmer. Add the vegetables and peas or spinach and simmer gently for 5 minutes, stirring regularly. If the sauce thickens too much, add a splash of water.

* Serve immediately with yoghurt and mango chutney.
